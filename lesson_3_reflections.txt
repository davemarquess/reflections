When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You would want to use a remote repository when working on a project with multiple contributors.  This allows for all contributors
on the project to have access to the repository, and allows them to share their latest commits with all project contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can pull changes at logical places in the project where a commit was made that you need on your local repository in order to work on the project.  This avoids clutter/unnecessary updates to your local repository.
